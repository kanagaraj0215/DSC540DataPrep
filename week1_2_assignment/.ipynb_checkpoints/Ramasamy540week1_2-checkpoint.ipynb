Also, use a single line of code involving dropwhile and lambda expressions to convert all the tuples to lists while dropping any leading zeros (for example, (0, 1, 2) becomes [1, 2]). Finally, write a function that takes a list like before and returns the actual number contained in it.\n",

As an example, if you pass [1, 2] to the function, it will return 12. Make sure that the return type is indeed a number and not a string. Although this task can be achieved using other tricks, we require that you treat the incoming list as a stack in the function and generate the number by reading the individual digits from the stack."
